Here are integration libraries for Magnum C++11/C++14 graphics engine,
providing integration of various math and physics libraries into the engine
itself.

BUILDING MAGNUM EXTRAS
======================

You can either use packaging scripts, which are stored in the
[package/](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/tree/master/package)
subdirectory, or compile and install everything manually. The building process
is similar to Magnum itself — see the
[building documentation](http://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/building-integration.html)
for more comprehensive guide for building, packaging and crosscompiling.

Minimal dependencies
--------------------

-   C++ compiler with good C++11 support. Compilers which are tested to have
    everything needed are **GCC** >= 4.7, **Clang** >= 3.1 and **MSVC** >= 2015.
    On Windows you can also use **MinGW-w64**.
-   **CMake** >= 2.8.12
-   **Corrade**, **Magnum** — The engine itself

Compilation, installation
-------------------------

The libraries can be built and installed using these commands:

```sh
git clone git://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration && cd magnum-integration
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
make -j
make install # sudo may be required
```

None of the libraries are built by default, see CMake options or the full
[building documentation](http://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/building-integration.html)
for more information about particular libraries and their dependencies.

Building and running unit tests
-------------------------------

If you want to build also unit tests (which are not built by default), pass
`-DBUILD_TESTS=ON` to CMake. Unit tests use Corrade's TestSuite framework and
can be run using

```sh
ctest --output-on-failure
```

in build directory. Everything should pass ;)

Building documentation
----------------------

The documentation is written using [Doxygen](https://doxygen.org) and is built
as part of of the main Magnum documentation. Clone the projects next to each
other and build the docs using the following:

```sh
cd ../magnum # to the directory where Magnum Doxyfile is
doxygen
```

You might need to create the `build/` directory if it doesn't exist yet.
Resulting HTML documentation will be in the `build/doc/` directory. Snapshot of
the documentation is [also available for online viewing](http://doc.magnum.graphics/).

CONTACT & SUPPORT
=================

If you want to contribute to Magnum, if you spotted a bug, need a feature or
have an awesome idea, you can get a copy of the sources from GitHub and start
right away! There is the already mentioned guide about
[how to download and build Magnum Integration](http://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/building-integration.html)
and also a guide about [coding style and best practices](http://doc.magnum.graphics/magnum/coding-style.html)
which you should follow to keep the library as consistent and maintainable as
possible.
