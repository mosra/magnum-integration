# We could drop this once we can use at least 3.3.1 (Ubuntu 16.04 has only 3.3
# beta, which doesn't have this target yet), however for Travis and AppVeyor
# we're using FindEigen3.cmake from the downloaded sources (because the
# Eigen3Config.cmake, which produces the actual targets, is not there -- only
# Eigen3Config.cmake.in). See the YML files for an extended rant. Also,
# FindEigen3 only defines EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR, not even EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIRS, so
# be extra careful. I also wanted to set INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
# of MagnumEigenIntegration to ${EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR} to avoid this target
# creation but that was ignored by CMake (?!). This works, tho.
