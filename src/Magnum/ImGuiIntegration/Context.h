@brief Dear ImGui context

Handles initialization and destruction of a Dear ImGui context and implements a
Magnum-based rendering backend.

@section ImGuiIntegration-Context-usage Usage

Creating the @ref Context instance will create the Dear ImGui context and make
it current. From that point on you can use ImGui calls.

@snippet ImGuiIntegration.cpp Context-usage

@subsection ImGuiIntegration-Context-usage-rendering Rendering

Use @ref newFrame() to initialize a ImGui frame and finally draw it with
@ref drawFrame() to the currently bound framebuffer. Dear ImGui requires
@ref GL::Renderer::Feature::ScissorTest "scissor test" to be enabled and
@ref GL::Renderer::Feature::DepthTest "depth test" to be disabled.
@ref GL::Renderer::Feature::Blending "Blending" should be enabled and set up as
below. The following snippet sets up all required renderer state and then
resets it back to default values. Adapt the state changes based on what else
you are rendering. Right before @ref drawFrame() you can call
@ref updateApplicationCursor() if your application implementation supports
setting cursors.

@snippet ImGuiIntegration-sdl2.cpp Context-usage-per-frame

<b></b>

@m_class{m-note m-warning}

@par
    As shown above, because Dear ImGui has frame-based event handling, you're
    * *required* to constantly @ref Platform::Sdl2Application::redraw() "redraw()",
    instead of just waiting on input events. While that's not a problem for
    games, for regular apps that unfortunately means your application will use
    the CPU even when completely idle.

<b></b>

@m_class{m-block m-info}

@par Reduced renderer state setup
    The above assumes you're drawing ImGui together with something else (a 3D
    scene in the background, for example). If you only draw ImGui alone, it's
    enough (and also faster) to set just the following in the constructor,
    without doing any renderer state changes each frame:
@par
    @snippet ImGuiIntegration.cpp Context-usage-state-imgui-only

@subsection ImGuiIntegration-Context-usage-events Event handling

The templated @ref handleMousePressEvent(), @ref handleMouseReleaseEvent() etc.
functions are meant to be used inside event handlers of application classes
such as @ref Platform::Sdl2Application, directly passing the @p event parameter
to them. The returned value is then @cpp true @ce if ImGui used the event (and
thus it shouldn't be propagated further) and @cpp false @ce otherwise.

@snippet ImGuiIntegration-sdl2.cpp Context-events

<b></b>

@m_class{m-note m-warning}

@par
    As shown above, implementation of those templated functions is provided in
    a separate @ref ImGuiIntegration/Context.hpp file --- don't forget to
    include it at the point of use to avoid linker errors. This is done in
    order to optimize compile times, as the event handling implementation is
    rather large. See @ref compilation-speedup-hpp for more information.

@subsection ImGuiIntegration-Context-usage-text-input Text input

UTF-8 text input is handled via @ref handleTextInputEvent() but the application
implementations only call
@ref Platform::Sdl2Application::textInputEvent() "textInputEvent()" when text
input is enabled. This is done because some platforms require explicit action
in order to start a text input (for example, to open an on-screen keyboard on
touch devices, or [IME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_method) for complex
alphabets). ImGui exposes its desire to capture text input during a call to
@ref newFrame(). Based on that, you can toggle the text input in the
application, for example using
@ref Platform::Sdl2Application::startTextInput() "startTextInput()" /
@ref Platform::Sdl2Application::stopTextInput() "stopTextInput()" in
@ref Platform::Sdl2Application or @link Platform::GlfwApplication @endlink:

@snippet ImGuiIntegration-sdl2.cpp Context-text-input

The above snippet also means that ImGui's @cpp InputQueueCharacters @ce will be
empty unless an text input box is focused --- so if you want to handle text
input through ImGui manually, you need to explicitly call
@ref Platform::Sdl2Application::startTextInput() "startTextInput()" /
@ref Platform::Sdl2Application::stopTextInput() "stopTextInput()" when desired.

@section ImGuiIntegration-Context-fonts Loading custom fonts

The @ref Context class does additional adjustments to ImGui font setup in order
to make their scaling DPI-aware. If you load custom fonts, it's recommended to
do that before the @ref Context class is created, in which case it picks up the
custom font as default. Create the ImGui context first, add the font and then
construct the integration using the @ref Context(ImGuiContext&, const Vector2i&)
constructor, passing the already created ImGui context to it:

@snippet ImGuiIntegration.cpp Context-custom-fonts

It's possible to load custom fonts after the @ref Context instance been
constructed as well, but you first need to clear the default font added during
@ref Context construction and finally call @ref relayout() to make it pick up
the updated glyph cache. Alternatively, if you don't call @cpp Clear() @ce, you
need to explicitly call @cpp PushFont() @ce to switch to a non-default one.
Compared to loading fonts before the @ref Context is created, this is the less
efficient option, as the glyph cache is unnecessarily built and discarded one
more time.

@snippet ImGuiIntegration-sdl2.cpp Context-custom-fonts-after

See the @ref ImGuiIntegration-Context-dpi "DPI awareness" section below for
more information about configuring the fonts for HiDPI screens.

@m_class{m-block m-warning}

@par Loading fonts from memory
    Note that, when using @cpp AddFontFromMemoryTTF() @ce (for example
    to load a font from @ref Corrade::Utility::Resource), ImGui by default
    takes over the memory ownership. In order to avoid memory corruption on
    exit, you need to explicitly tell it to *not* do that by setting
    @cpp ImFontConfig::FontDataOwnedByAtlas @ce to @cpp false @ce:
@par
    @snippet ImGuiIntegration.cpp Context-custom-fonts-resource

@section ImGuiIntegration-Context-dpi DPI awareness

There are three separate concepts for DPI-aware UI rendering:

-   UI size --- size of the user interface to which all widgets are positioned
-   Window size --- size of the window to which all input events are related
-   Framebuffer size --- size of the framebuffer the UI is being rendered to

Depending on the platform and use case, each of these three values can be
different. For example, a game menu screen can have the UI size the same
regardless of window size. Or on Retina macOS you can have different window and
framebuffer size and the UI size might be related to window size but
independent on the framebuffer size.

When using for example @ref Platform::Sdl2Application or other `*Application`
implementations, you usually have three values at your disposal ---
@ref Platform::Sdl2Application::windowSize() "windowSize()",
@ref Platform::Sdl2Application::framebufferSize() "framebufferSize()" and
@ref Platform::Sdl2Application::dpiScaling() "dpiScaling()". ImGui interfaces
are usually positioned with pixel units, getting more room on bigger windows.
A non-DPI-aware setup would be simply this:

@snippet ImGuiIntegration-sdl2.cpp Context-dpi-unaware

If you want the UI to keep a reasonable physical size and stay crisp with
different pixel densities, pass a ratio of window size and DPI scaling to the
UI size:

@snippet ImGuiIntegration-sdl2.cpp Context-dpi-aware

Finally, by clamping the first @p size parameter you can achieve various other
results like limiting it to a minimal / maximal area or have it fully scaled
with window size. When window size, framebuffer size or DPI scaling changes
(usually as a response to @ref Platform::Sdl2Application::viewportEvent() "viewportEvent()"),
call @ref relayout() with the new values. If the pixel density is changed, this
will result in the font caches being rebuilt.

@m_class{m-note m-warning}

@par
    Additional steps are needed on some platforms in order to make the
    executable itself DPI-aware --- otherwise it will appear blurry on HiDPI
    displays. See the corresponding sections in
    @ref platforms-windows-hidpi "Windows" and
    @ref platforms-macos-hidpi "macOS / iOS" platform docs for details.

@subsection ImGuiIntegration-Context-dpi-fonts HiDPI fonts

@note
    The default font used by ImGui, [Proggy Clean](https://www.dafont.com/proggy-clean.font),
    is a bitmap one, becoming rather blurry and blocky in larger sizes. It's
    recommended to switch to a different font for a crisper experience on HiDPI
    screens.

There are further important steps for DPI awareness if you are supplying custom
fonts. Use the @ref Context(ImGuiContext&, const Vector2&, const Vector2i&, const Vector2i&)
constructor and pre-scale their size by the ratio of @p size and
@p framebufferSize. If you don't do that, the fonts will appear tiny on HiDPI
screens. Example:

@snippet ImGuiIntegration-sdl2.cpp Context-custom-fonts-dpi

If you supplied custom fonts and pixel density changed, in order to regenerate
them you have to clear the font atlas and re-add all fonts again with a
different scaling *before* calling @ref relayout(), for example:

@snippet ImGuiIntegration-sdl2.cpp Context-relayout-fonts-dpi

If you don't do that, the fonts stay at the original scale, not matching the
new UI scaling anymore. If you didn't supply any custom font, the function will
reconfigure the builtin font automatically.

@section ImGuiIntegration-Context-large-meshes Large meshes

Complex user interfaces or widgets like [ImPlot](https://github.com/epezent/implot)
may end up creating large meshes with more than 65k vertices. Because ImGui
defaults to 16-bit index buffers this can lead to asserts or visual errors.

If the underlying GL context supports @ref GL::Mesh::setBaseVertex() "setting the base vertex for indexed meshes"
the rendering backend sets the @cpp ImGuiBackendFlags_RendererHasVtxOffset @ce
flag. This lets ImGui know the backend can handle per-draw vertex offsets,
removing the 65k limitation altogether. Support for that requires one of the
following:

@requires_gl32 Extension @gl_extension{ARB,draw_elements_base_vertex}
@requires_gles32 Extension @gl_extension{OES,draw_elements_base_vertex} or
    @gl_extension{EXT,draw_elements_base_vertex} on OpenGL ES 3.1 and older
@requires_webgl_extension WebGL 2.0 and extension
    @webgl_extension{WEBGL,draw_instanced_base_vertex_base_instance}

If you can't guarantee that the required GL versions or extensions will be
available at runtime (mostly relevant on WebGL) the next best option is to
change ImGui's index type to 32-bit by adding the following line to the
@ref ImGuiIntegration-configuration "ImGui user config":

@code{.cpp}
#define ImDrawIdx unsigned int
@endcode

This doubles the size of the index buffer but is guaranteed to work on all GL
versions.

@section ImGuiIntegration-Context-multiple-contexts Multiple contexts

Each instance of @ref Context creates a new ImGui context. You can also pass an
existing context to the @ref Context(ImGuiContext&, const Vector2i&)
constructor, which will then take ownership (and thus delete it on
destruction). Switching between various @cpp ImGui @ce contexts wrapped in
@ref Context instances is done automatically when calling any of the
@ref relayout(), @ref newFrame(), @ref drawFrame() APIs or the event handling
functions. You can also query the instance-specific context with @ref context()
and call @cpp ImGui::SetContextCurent() @ce manually on that.

It's also possible to create a context-less instance using the
@ref Context(NoCreateT) constructor and release context ownership using
@ref release(). Such instances, together with moved-out instances are empty and
calling any API that interacts with ImGui is not allowed on these.
