# To help Homebrew and other packages, ImGui sources can be cloned to
# src/MagnumExternal/ImGui and we will use those without any extra effort
# from the outside. The *.cpp files from there will get compiled into the
# ImGuiIntegration library and the *.h files will get installed here. The
# FindImGui.cmake module then will look into include/MagnumExternal/ImGui as
# a fallback if IMGUI_DIR is not set and no CMake config file is found.
