@section changelog-integration-2018-04 2018.04

Released 2018-05-01, tagged as
[v2018.04](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/releases/tag/v2018.04).

@subsection changelog-integration-2018-04-dependencies Dependency changes

-   Building for Android now requires CMake 3.7 with builtin Android
    crosscompilation support, the old toolchains were removed. Only the Clang
    and libc++ toolchain is now supported, support for GCC and libstdc++ was
    dropped, as it was still missing some important C++11 functionality. See
    @ref building-cross-android for more information.

@subsection changelog-integration-2018-04-changes Changes and improvements

-   Second experimental version of the @ref DartIntegration library ---
    `DartIntegration::DartObject` and `DartIntegration::DartSkeleton` got
    replaced with @ref DartIntegration::Object and @ref DartIntegration::World,
    which is now able to track updates to all shapes and propagate that to the
    user. See [mosra/magnum-integration#29](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/29),
    [mosra/magnum-integration#30](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/issues/30).

@subsection changelog-integration-2018-04-buildsystem Build system

-   Homebrew macOS packages were updated to install the stable version by
    default
-   Fixed the Debian package after introducing `SOVERSION` to all libraries
    (see [mosra/magnum#237](https://github.com/mosra/magnum/issues/237))
-   Fixed the Debian package to not include a revision. While just a warning on
    Ubuntu, it's a hard error on Debian. (See [mosra/corrade#44](https://github.com/mosra/corrade/issues/44).)

    with code coverage on [codecov.io](https://codecov.io/gh/mosra/magnum-integration);
    replacing the unmaintained and outdated Jenkins configuration
-   Support for CMake subprojects. You can now clone Magnum Plugins into a
    subdirectory in your project and add it using @cmake add_subdirectory() @ce.
    The @cmake find_package() @ce command will then use the CMake subproject
    instead of looking for it in system-wide locations.
-   Reworked CMake buildsystem to use the new imported target workflow, see
    @ref cmake-integration for more information
-   CMake targets are now organized in folders for better development
    experience in IDEs such as Visual Studio or Xcode

    with both debug and release libraries (see
    [mosra/magnum-integration#14](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/14))
-   Fixed static @ref BulletIntegration libraries being treated as dynamic (see
    [mosra/magnum-integration#16](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration/pull/16))
-   Enabling only C++ in CMake @cmake project() @ce call, if possible, to speed
    up initial CMake run
